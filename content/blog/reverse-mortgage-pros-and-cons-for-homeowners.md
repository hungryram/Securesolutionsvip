No two retirements are the same, which is why a reverse mortgage may be ideal for some and not as advantageous for others. As you continue to explore your retirement options, add this list of reverse mortgage pros and cons for homeowners to assist you in deciding whether a reverse mortgage can help you achieve a better retirement—try to view them objectively with regard to your own situation.

Essentially, a reverse mortgage is a way for older adults, age 62 and over, to convert a portion of their home equity into cash that they can use at their discretion, and the loan for which they qualify does not have to be repaid for as long as they continue living in their home*.

Despite providing homeowners with cash, on top of eliminating their monthly mortgage payments, reverse mortgages are not for everyone. Rather, they work best when they are used responsibly and sustainably as part of an overall financial plan to help you meet your specific retirement needs and goals.

\*You must continue to maintain your home, pay your property taxes and homeowners insurance and comply with all loan terms.

What Are The Pros of a Reverse Mortgage?

With a reverse mortgage loan, you receive a defined cash amount and eliminate your monthly mortgage payments. Plus, your reverse mortgage loan does not have to be repaid until you sell the house, move out or pass away*.

_*You must continue to maintain your home, pay your property taxes and homeowners insurance and comply with all loan terms._

The funds you receive are a loan, not income; therefore, they are not taxable. (Please consult your tax advisor for more information.)

You designate the disbursement plan that best meets your retirement goals. The proceeds from a reverse mortgage can be taken in a lump sum (60% the first year and the remaining 40% the following year), paid out over time in predictable amounts, or set aside as a line of credit that grows over time the longer it goes unused.

There are virtually no restrictions or requirements on how you can spend your loan proceeds.

Paying off large bills, consolidating debt, improving the home for comfort, safety and entertaining, protecting investments, covering long-term health care needs, starting a grandchild’s college fund, and creating a stronger safety net are just some of the responsible and strategic ways older adults are putting their reverse mortgages to work.

Neither you nor your heirs will ever owe more than your home is worth. No assets, other than the home itself needs to be used to pay off your loan balance.
