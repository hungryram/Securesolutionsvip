Beginning January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019, the national lending limit for Home Equity Conversion Mortgages will increase to $726,525 from $679,650.

To complement AAG’s fixed- and adjustable rate HECMs, the company successfully set out to offer reverse mortgages for owners of higher-value homes that appraised for more than the government’s HECM limits. These proprietary fixed, flex and select products now offer loan limits of up to $4 million.

Details were just announced in [**Mortgagee Letter 2018-12**](https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/OCHCO/documents/18-12hsgml.pdf). This new loan limit is also applicable to Freddie Mac’s special exception areas: Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, and the Virgin Islands.
