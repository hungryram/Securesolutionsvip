## What is a Reverse Mortgage Loan?

To learn more about reverse mortgages, read through the following commonly asked questions–and consider adding this secure and viable financial planning tool to your portfolio of products.

### Is a reverse mortgage an FHA loan?

Yes. A FHA reverse mortgage is a government-insured loan for senior borrowers age 62 and older. This financial tool allows the borrower to access a portion of home equity and convert it into cash to utilize proceeds for however he/she sees fit. Common uses include paying for medical bills or other debt, home repair and improvements, traveling and supplementing your retirement portfolio, among others.

### What are my payment options with a reverse mortgage?

The length of the reverse mortgage loan is partly determined by the disbursement option chosen, and funds can be disbursed in a number of ways. Proceeds may be provided through:

* A full or partial lump sum
* A growing line of credit
* Monthly payments (tenure or modified tenure plans available)
* Combination of any of these.

The choice is ultimately yours, but your American Apple Mortgage partner will educate you on how to guide you through the disbursement option that is best suited for your situation.

### What are the benefits of a reverse mortgage loan?

* Borrowers won’t owe more than the value of their homes.
* As long as the borrower complies with the loan terms, he/she doesn’t have to make payments on the loan.
* With a reverse mortgage loan, the borrower will not lose Social Security or Medicare benefits.
* Reverse mortgages afford borrowers greater financial freedom and control, providing them the dignity and security they deserve.

### How do I qualify for a reverse mortgage loan?

To qualify for a reverse mortgage, borrowers must be at least 62 years of age, own their home and occupy it as their primary residence (among other requirements). If they have equity in their homes and are looking for additional income, a reverse mortgage can provide the funding needed to allow them to stay in their homes.

### Isn’t a reverse mortgage a loan of last resort?

This is a popular misconception. When used wisely, a reverse mortgage can be a very powerful, viable and strategic financial tool. There is no better product more readily available to the senior population in terms of supplementing retirement, balancing a portfolio and managing retirement risks. However, the reverse mortgage should be evaluated based on the borrower’s particular needs and financial background.

Many seniors are resistant to the idea of selling the home they’ve lived in for years. That’s why a reverse mortgage is a convenient solution. You can stay in his or her home that they are comfortable living in while enjoying an additional revenue stream to cover health care costs or other expenses.
